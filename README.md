<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is an experiment trying to replicate the [Chwazi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tendadigital.chwaziApp&hl=es_AR) app as a PWA.

Everyone puts its finger on the screen, and after some time, one will be selected.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Its plain old HTML and JS, you only need an https server to run the service worker and make it work offline.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Open the server or the *index.html* file and start putting fingers on the screen, thats all.
